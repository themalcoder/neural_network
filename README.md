# Neural Network From Scractch

This is the implementation of neural networks from scratch. Right now I am not sure what or how this gonna proceed in the future. But I am planning to impelement it in JavaScript, Java and Python.

## Update
- JavaScript version was submitted as the project along with the website.
- Python version was soon done and presented a new dataset for this version as the course requirement.
- Java was used in Processing for the generation of shapes and their random sizes and orientation.

JavaScript and Java will help me visualise the stuff that's going on will enable me to interact with the model and train/test them on the fly, i.e., in real time and then the Python version can be tested and built even further and could use the pre-built python libraries (and also the JavaScript versions of them). 

This might lead me to build my own API for identifying the equation and use that in my app.

Website related to this work has been taken down. Will be putting it sometime later with more things.
