## Neural Network From Scractch
### This is the implementation of neural networks from scratch. Right now I am not sure what or how this gonna proceed in the future. But I am planning to impelement it in JavaScript, Java and Python.

### JavaScript and Java will help me visualise the stuff that's going on will enable me to interact with the model and train/test them on the fly, i.e., in real time and then the Python version can be tested and built even further and could use the pre-built python libraries (and also the JavaScript versions of them). 

### This might lead me to build my own API for identifying the equation and use that in my app.
